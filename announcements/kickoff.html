        <p>Hello everyone!</p>

        <p>Welcome back to another college admissions cycle! We would like to extend our tutoring services once again to prospective college students, as well as reintroduce ourselves and introduce some new changes to our services.</p>
        
        <p>We are three college students attending Stanford, MIT, and the University of Virginia and have collectively received over $500,000 in scholarships. Together, we hope to bring out the best in our applicants through an important part of the college application: your essays. In the past, we have collaborated with applicants who have gained admissions to highly selective schools such as the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Stanford, Duke, UC Berkeley, Purdue University, UT Austin, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech.</p>
        
        <p>Many colleges will be releasing supplemental essays on August 1st, which is only a week away. Along with this, the Common Application essay, a &lsquo;universal&rsquo; essay that will be sent to all colleges applied to via the Common Application is already open! In order to make the most out of your essay, consider our essay editing services. We offer offline editing with up to five revisions for your personal statements within just four days after receiving drafts! We primarily focus on the Common Application essay, but also offer personalized editing of college-specific supplementals at low prices. Don&rsquo;t know where to start? We also offer brainstorming sessions with a member of our team via Zoom to assist you with getting on track to crafting a remarkable college essay.</p>
        
        <p>We look forward to making the most out of your application!</p>
